   Summarize the weekly work reports of the department members to form the department's weekly work report.
   Please ensure that the final document is in Chinese.
   Please try not to compress the content and ensure that all work content is included.
   Don't put names in, just the job they did.
   You only need to call the member weekly report acquisition tool once, do not call it repeatedly, because you will get the same thing every time.
   Please make sure to ask humans if they want to send emails and publish Yuque documents after completing the overall creation of the department weekly report.
